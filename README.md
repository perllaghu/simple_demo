# Jupyter Notebooks in Noteable

Use one of the buttons above to have a _very simple_ notebook started on a service called Binder.

This notebook will _not_ have the large suite of libraries and extensions available in Noteable's notebooks, however it will allow you to explore what a Jupyter Notebook _is_, and why we call them "interactive notebooks"

**NOTE** This notebook can take a long time to start - notebooks in the Noteable service start in seconds!
